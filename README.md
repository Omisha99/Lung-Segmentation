# 🫁 Lung Segmentation using Deep Learning

## 📌 Overview

This project focuses on lung segmentation from chest X-ray images using deep convolutional neural networks. We implement and compare two architectures:

- U-Net
- ResUNet

The models are evaluated on two datasets:
- SHCXR
- JSRT

We analyze both within-dataset performance and cross-dataset generalization.

---

## 📊 Key Results

- High segmentation performance (Dice ≈ 0.95+)
- Small performance drop in cross-dataset experiments
- ResUNet slightly outperforms U-Net
- Models generalize reasonably well across datasets

## 🧠 Models

### U-Net
- Encoder–decoder architecture  
- Skip connections for spatial detail  
- DoubleConv blocks (Conv + BatchNorm + ReLU)

### ResUNet
- Same structure as U-Net  
- Uses residual blocks  
- Improves training stability and performance
